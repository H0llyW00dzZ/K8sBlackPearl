### Shall We have Drink ?

This repository is the continuation of development from [`WorkerK8S`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/H0llyW00dzZ/go-urlshortner@v0.4.10/workerk8s), developed by the best Go programmers.

### Reason for Continuation

In real-world applications, the complexity and cost can escalate quickly. `K8sBlackPearl` was created as an in-house solution, written in Go, to streamline Kubernetes management and reduce operational expenses. Building on the foundation of `WorkerK8S`, aiming to provide a more efficient and cost-effective tool, with a simplified interface for Kubernetes cluster management.
